# Figure Generation Utilities

This directory contains utilities and scripts for generating figures used in the paper "Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Analysis of Large Vision Language Model".

## Files

- `fig_utils.py`: Utility functions for figure generation and visualization
- `expectation_bound_visualize_main.py`: Main script for visualizing expectation bounds and theoretical analysis results

## Usage

These scripts are used to generate the figures that appear in the research paper. They contain the visualization code for plotting experimental results, theoretical predictions, and comparative analyses.

## Dependencies

- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn (optional, for enhanced plotting)

## Note

These utilities are primarily for reproducing the figures from the paper. For running the main experiments, please refer to the `demos/` directory.
